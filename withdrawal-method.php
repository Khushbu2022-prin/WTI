In some cases, you may simply choose to go with the most convenient forex deposit method for you. Perhaps you have a FasaPay account, for example, and have a strong preference for using it for all online transactions. In that case, it would be as simple as picking a broker which offers FasaPay as a deposit method.
                                        </li>
<li>Reputation
If you are thinking about opening new e-wallet accounts or exploring prepaid card options, you will also need to think about reputation. You will want to pick a deposit method which has proven to be secure and reliable.
                                        </li>
<li>Anonymity
This criteria is not applicable at most broker sites, which will need to verify your identity in order to issue withdrawals. Some cryptocurrency sites may make an exception, however.
                                        </li>
<li>Privacy
Even though you will almost certainly need to provide proof of your identity to your FX broker, keep in mind that there are some personal details you may not have to disclose. For example, you may be able to keep your banking information private if you choose to deposit and withdraw using an e-wallet or cryptocurrency wallet.</li>
